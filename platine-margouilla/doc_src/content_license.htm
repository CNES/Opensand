              PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
              Version 2, June 1991<br>
              Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
              59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA<br>
              Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
              of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
              [This is the first released version of the library GPL. It is<br>
              numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]<br>
              Preamble<br>
              The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
              freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
              Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<br>
              free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<br>
              This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some<br>
              specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any<br>
              other libraries whose authors decide to use it. You can use it for<br>
              your libraries, too.<br>
              When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
              price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that 
              you<br>
              have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge 
              for<br>
              this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get 
              it<br>
              if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of 
              it<br>
              in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br>
              To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
              anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br>
              These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you 
              if<br>
              you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.<br>
              For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br>
              or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we 
              gave<br>
              you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br>
              code. If you link a program with the library, you must provide<br>
              complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink 
              them<br>
              with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling<br>
              it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>
              Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright<br>
              the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal<br>
              permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br>
              Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain<br>
              that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br>
              library. If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, 
              we<br>
              want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original<br>
              version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect 
              on<br>
              the original authors' reputations.<br>
              <br>
              Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br>
              patents. We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing 
              free<br>
              software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect<br>
              transforming the program into proprietary software. To prevent this,<br>
              we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's<br>
              free use or not licensed at all.<br>
              Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary<br>
              GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs. 
              This<br>
              license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain<br>
              designated libraries. This license is quite different from the ordinary<br>
              one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything 
              in it is<br>
              the same as in the ordinary license.<br>
              The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries 
              is that<br>
              they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding 
              to a<br>
              program and simply using it. Linking a program with a library, without<br>
              changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, 
              and is<br>
              analogous to running a utility program or application program. However, 
              in<br>
              a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, 
              a<br>
              derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public 
              License<br>
              treats it as such.<br>
              Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General<br>
              Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software<br>
              sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries. We<br>
              concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.<br>
              However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive 
              the<br>
              users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the<br>
              libraries themselves. This Library General Public License is intended 
              to<br>
              permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while<br>
              preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the 
              free<br>
              libraries that are incorporated in them. (We have not seen how to 
              achieve<br>
              this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it 
              as regards<br>
              changes in the actual functions of the Library.) The hope is that 
              this<br>
              will lead to faster development of free libraries.<br>
              The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
              modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between 
              a<br>
              &quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses 
              the library&quot;. The<br>
              former contains code derived from the library, while the latter 
              only<br>
              works together with the library.<br>
              Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary<br>
              General Public License rather than by this special one.<br>
              <br>
              GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
              TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
              0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which<br>
              contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized<br>
              party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library<br>
              General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;). Each 
              licensee is<br>
              addressed as &quot;you&quot;.<br>
              A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or 
              data<br>
              prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br>
              (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br>
              The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library 
              or work<br>
              which has been distributed under these terms. A &quot;work based 
              on the<br>
              Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under<br>
              copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or 
              a<br>
              portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br>
              straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation 
              is<br>
              included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)<br>
              &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the 
              work for<br>
              making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code 
              means<br>
              all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br>
              interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br>
              and installation of the library.<br>
              Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are 
              not<br>
              covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of<br>
              running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output 
              from<br>
              such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work 
              based<br>
              on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool 
              for<br>
              writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br>
              and what the program that uses the Library does.<br>
              <br>
              1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br>
              complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided 
              that<br>
              you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br>
              appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br>
              all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of 
              any<br>
              warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br>
              Library.<br>
              You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br>
              and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange 
              for a<br>
              fee.<br>
              <br>
              2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br>
              of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br>
              distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 
              1<br>
              above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
              a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>
              b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br>
              stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
              c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br>
              charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>
              d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or 
              a<br>
              table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br>
              the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br>
              is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br>
              in the event an application does not supply such function or<br>
              table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br>
              its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
              (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br>
              a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br>
              application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br>
              application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br>
              be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br>
              root function must still compute square roots.)<br>
              These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If<br>
              identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br>
              and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works 
              in<br>
              themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
              sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you<br>
              distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work 
              based<br>
              on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms 
              of<br>
              this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
              entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who 
              wrote<br>
              it.<br>
              Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
              your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent 
              is to<br>
              exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
              collective works based on the Library.<br>
              In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br>
              with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume 
              of<br>
              a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
              the scope of this License.<br>
              3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br>
              License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. 
              To do<br>
              this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, 
              so<br>
              that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 
              2,<br>
              instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of 
              the<br>
              ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br>
              that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change 
              in<br>
              these notices.<br>
              <br>
              Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br>
              that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to 
              all<br>
              subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br>
              This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br>
              the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>
              4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br>
              derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable 
              form<br>
              under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br>
              it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, 
              which<br>
              must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on 
              a<br>
              medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
              If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br>
              from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy 
              the<br>
              source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br>
              distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
              compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
              5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br>
              Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled 
              or<br>
              linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;. 
              Such a<br>
              work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br>
              therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>
              However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the 
              Library<br>
              creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because 
              it<br>
              contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that 
              uses the<br>
              library&quot;. The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br>
              Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br>
              When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from 
              a header file<br>
              that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be 
              a<br>
              derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br>
              Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br>
              linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. 
              The<br>
              threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br>
              If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br>
              structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br>
              functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br>
              file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br>
              work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of 
              the<br>
              Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br>
              Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br>
              distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 
              6.<br>
              Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br>
              whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br>
              <br>
              6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or<br>
              link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to 
              produce a<br>
              work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br>
              under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br>
              modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br>
              engineering for debugging such modifications.<br>
              You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br>
              Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered 
              by<br>
              this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work<br>
              during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br>
              copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br>
              directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do 
              one<br>
              of these things:<br>
              a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br>
              machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br>
              changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br>
              Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br>
              with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work 
              that<br>
              uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that 
              the<br>
              user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br>
              executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood<br>
              that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br>
              Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br>
              to use the modified definitions.)<br>
              b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br>
              least three years, to give the same user the materials<br>
              specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br>
              than the cost of performing this distribution.<br>
              c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br>
              from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br>
              specified materials from the same place.<br>
              d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br>
              materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br>
              For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses 
              the<br>
              Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed 
              for<br>
              reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,<br>
              the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally<br>
              distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br>
              components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system 
              on<br>
              which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br>
              the executable.<br>
              It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br>
              restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br>
              accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot<br>
              use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br>
              distribute.<br>
              <br>
              7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
              Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br>
              facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br>
              library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based 
              on<br>
              the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br>
              permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br>
              a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br>
              based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br>
              facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the<br>
              Sections above.<br>
              b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br>
              that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br>
              where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
              8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br>
              the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any<br>
              attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br>
              distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate 
              your<br>
              rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies,<br>
              or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br>
              terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br>
              9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
              signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify 
              or<br>
              distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are<br>
              prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, 
              by<br>
              modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br>
              Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, 
              and<br>
              all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
              the Library or works based on it.<br>
              10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on 
              the<br>
              Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
              original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br>
              subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further<br>
              restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
              You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties 
              to<br>
              this License.<br>
              <br>
              11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
              infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
              conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement 
              or<br>
              otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they 
              do not<br>
              excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot<br>
              distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under 
              this<br>
              License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence 
              you<br>
              may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent<br>
              license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library 
              by<br>
              all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, 
              then<br>
              the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be 
              to<br>
              refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br>
              If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable 
              under any<br>
              particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended 
              to apply,<br>
              and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br>
              It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe 
              any<br>
              patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of 
              any<br>
              such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
              integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br>
              implemented by public license practices. Many people have made<br>
              generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
              through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
              system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
              to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
              impose that choice.<br>
              This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed 
              to<br>
              be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
              12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted 
              in<br>
              certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, 
              the<br>
              original copyright holder who places the Library under this License 
              may add<br>
              an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those 
              countries,<br>
              so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not 
              thus<br>
              excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation 
              as if<br>
              written in the body of this License.<br>
              13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br>
              versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.<br>
              Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<br>
              but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
              Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library<br>
              specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<br>
              &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following 
              the terms and<br>
              conditions either of that version or of any later version published 
              by<br>
              the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a<br>
              license version number, you may choose any version ever published 
              by<br>
              the Free Software Foundation.<br>
              <br>
              14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<br>
              programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<br>
              write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is<br>
              copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<br>
              Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our<br>
              decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free 
              status<br>
              of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br>
              and reuse of software generally.<br>
              NO WARRANTY<br>
              15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br>
              WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE 
              LAW.<br>
              EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<br>
              OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY 
              OF ANY<br>
              KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, 
              THE<br>
              IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
              PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<br>
              LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<br>
              THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
              16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br>
              WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<br>
              AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO 
              YOU<br>
              FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br>
              CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE 
              THE<br>
              LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<br>
              RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES 
              OR A<br>
              FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN 
              IF<br>
              SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF 
              SUCH<br>
              DAMAGES.<br>
              END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</font></p>
