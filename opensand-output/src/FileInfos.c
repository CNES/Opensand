/* This method may return a complete filename or a formatting string requiring further processing, 
    ex: "NCC_%d_param.conf"
    The caller shall then use sprintf(...) to obtain the complete filename.

  In optimised compilation mode, local variables are de-allocated as soon as the method is
  exited; that's why a local string is not used in this method and strings are returned
  directly using return() function.
