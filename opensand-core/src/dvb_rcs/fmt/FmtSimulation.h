// Be careful:
//  - both MODCODs definitions are used on DAMA controller to get the
//    needed information (Rs, SNR, ...) for allocation computation
//  - down/forward MODCOD definitions are also used on appropriate PhysicStd to get
//    the Frames size
//  - up/return MODCOD simulation ID is used on DVB-RCS up/return link,
//    we need the minimum supported MODCOD in order to choose the allocated
//    carrier in DAMA (needed by DamaCtrlRcs)
//  - down/forward MODCOD is used on DVB-S2 forward link on GW to get the minimum
//    supported MODCOD used in BBFrames (needed by DvbS2Std)
// Thus we instanciate this everywhere but only the GW and SAT instance may handle terminals
