// TODO rename MODCOD and DRA forward/return ?

// Be careful:
//  - MODCOD and DRA definitions are used on DAMA controller to get the
//    needed information (Rs, SNR, ...) for allocation computation
//  - MODCOD definitions are also used on appropriate PhysicStd to get
//    the Frames  size
//  - DRA simulation ID is used on DVB-RCS up/return link, we need the minimum
//    supported DRA in order to choose the allocated carrier in DAMA (needed by DamaCtrlRcs)
//  - MODCOD is used on DVB-S2 forward link on GW to get the minimum supported MODCOD
//    used in BBFrames (needed by DvbS2Std)
// Thus we instanciate this everywhere but only the GW and SAT instance may handle terminals
