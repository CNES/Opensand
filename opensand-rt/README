Design
------

The RT library is built upon 2 concepts:

 * A channel system that allows to define how data flows in the application;
 * A block system that allows to organize channels between them in a
   stack-like fashion.

Each block defines 2 channels: one to flow data upwards and one to flow data
downwards. Blocks can then be connected on top of each other so that the
upward channel of a block on top receive data from the upward channel of the
block below, handles it, and transfer it to the upward channel of the block
above. Same goes for the downward channels that takes data from the block
above and transfer it to the block below.

Blocks also connect their channel together so they can share data if they
decide to.


Channels react to events which can be of several types:

 * Messages: when data flows from one channel to another;
 * Timers: when a certain amount of time passed;
 * IO: when some data has been writen into a socket, file...;
 * Signals: when the process catches a given signal.

Each channel runs its event loop in a dedicated thread.


Lastly, several kind of channels with varying number of input or output
connections allows to connect blocks in several ways:

 * One block above and one block below (legacy);
 * One block above and several blocks below (the downward channel must be
   parametrized by a “key” type to select where the message should go);
 * Several blocks above and one block below (the upward channel must be
   parametrized by a “key” type to select where the message should go);
 * Several blocks above and several blocks below (both the upward and downward
   channels must define a “key” type).

And advanced channels connection capabilities allows to bypass the whole block
structure at once.


Library
-------

The sources are in the src subdirectory. The sources a library
that allows penSAND block communications and events management.
See the INSTALL file to learn how to buildv the library.
To compile an application using the OpenSAND RT library use the
following expression:
g++ `pkg-config opensand_rt --cflags` myappli.cpp `pkg-config opensand_rt --libs` -o myapplip
