  workstations behind the ST or GW to connect on the satellite network

Template: opensand-daemon/network/lan_ipv4
Type: string
Description: Satellite Terminal network IPv4 address
  Select the IPv4 address/mask of the Satellite Terminal
  It is recommended to use a common network for all STs (with mask smaller than
  the ST lan mask) for workstation routing management
  You must use a mask smaller than /28
  The TUN and bridge interfaces will have the same address with last byte
  + 2 and 3 respectively

Template: opensand-daemon/network/lan_ipv6
Type: string

Template: opensand-daemon/network/config_level
Type: select
Default: ADVANCED
Choices: AUTOMATIC, ADVANCED
Description: Level of network configuration
  Select the level of configuration you need for your network:
   - AUTOMATIC: the daemon automatically read your network configuration
                according to the choosen interfaces and try to keep it for
                OpenSAND, be sure that your network will be compatible with
                OpenSAND,
   - ADVANCED: you will be able to select the interfaces and addresses,
               for default configuration choose this mode and press enter for
               each value.
  Basically, you need to respect the following constraints on emulation network:
   - on emulation network all the hosts shall be on the same sub-network (i.e.
     should have the same mask),
   - on ST or GW lan, your workstations should be in the same subnetwork as the
     terminal if not configured automatically with DHCP
