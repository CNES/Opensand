 * This small program creates plenty of NetPacket objects. It should _NEVER_
 * segfault, but stop gracefully with a message saying that the program failed
 * to create a new NetPacket object. If it segfaults, the NetPacket::new()
 * operator is broken and should be fixed !
 *
 * This program is leaking memory, it could be fixed by storing all the
 * allocated pointers, but this is not a great task and being clean is not
 * the goal of this very small test program :)
