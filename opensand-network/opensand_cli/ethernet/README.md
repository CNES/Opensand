## Pre-requisite

'iproute2' and 'make' packages are required. You can install them from your command line terminal by issuing
```bash
apt-get install iproute2 make
```

## Goal of this configuration

This configuration allows to deploy OpenSAND with an Ethernet configuration. No VLAN are present in this configuration, and no QoS can be done in this case. Ethernet frames on OpenSAND are default IPv4 frames (Ethertype = 0x0800). Frames generated by workstations must be 0x0800 frames too.

## Example configuration

We assume the configuration we want is the following. It represents the default configuration of the Makefiles. The parameters can be changed in each Makefile to be adapted to the topology.

![Topology](/opensand-network/opensand_cli/ethernet/ethernet_without_vlan.png)

## Usage

All the files in each subfolder (GW, SAT, ST, GW_WS, ST_WS) have to be copied to the corresponding machine.

Once this is done, you have to run Makefiles as root from your command line terminal. Makefiles for WS can be done at any moment, but for OpenSAND entities this order in mandatory: SAT, GW, ST.

The Makefile useful targets are:

- ```make network```: configure the network
- ```make run```: configure the network and launch opensand agent (does not exist on WS)
- ```make stop```: stop opensand agent (does not exist on WS)
- ```make clean```: remove all changes made by network target, and clean network configuration
- ```make```: execute clean, network and run

## Testing

To test the good behavior, with the example topology we chose, we can ping WS_ST from WS_GW:

```bash
ping 192.168.1.3
```

The ping should receive response, with a delay of around 500ms.

The ping must also pass between GW and ST directly, still with 500ms delay. For example on GW:

```bash
ping 192.168.63.15
```

## Now, you can enjoy it!
