# Easy OpenSAND CLI

This is a small piece of software allowing to facility the setup of a minimal OpenSAND platform following a step-by-step approach. 
Unlike to 'OpenSAND CLI' where you have to manualy run each commands, 'Easy OpenSAND CLI' groups commands by step: configure/clean network and run/stop opensand binaries.
Technically, commands are grouped within makefiles and organized into Phony targets or recipes to be executed. Where a recipe consists to one or more actions to carry out.

Its provides for both modes, IP and ETH, makefiles to run on each component SAT, GW and ST. 

## Pre-requisite

As with OpenSAND CLI, iproute2 and make packages are required. You can install them from your command line terminal by issuing
```bash
apt-get install iproute2 make
```

## Usage
It is assumed that the simulation file are already configured and installed on each component, as well as this tool.
You need to modify each makefile to adapt them to your platform by correctly replacing variables value.

Once this done, you have to run makefiles as root from your command line terminal as follows:
```bash
make network
make run
```
First command configure network interfaces and routing, and second one run OpenSAND binary.
If needed, you can run 

```bash
make network
make run
```
to respectively stop emualtion and clean network configurations.
