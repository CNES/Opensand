# OpenSAND Network

This folder provides tools to help network configuration on OpenSAND entities.

The `opensand_network` folder provides a Python module to easily create TAP,
bridges and routing on a machine or inside a net-namespace.

The [`opensand_cli`](opensand_cli/README.md) is a collection of Makefiles to
easily configure your network on a machine and run a simple configuration of
OpenSAND once done.

## opensand-network

This script provide an API to easily manage net-namespaces for your OpenSAND
processes. This allows to easily run your entire emulation on a single machine.
It is comprised of 3 main commands:

```
sudo ./opensand-network setup -g 6 -s 0 -t 1 2 3
```

This command will create a net-namespace for a gateway with an ID of 6, setup
a bridge and a tap inside; it will create a second net-namespace for a satellite
with an ID of 0; lastly it will create 3 net-namespace for a terminal, with
respective IDs of 1, 2, and 3, and setup a bridge and a tap inside each of them.

```
sudo ./opensand-network launch gw 6 path/to/topology.xml path/to/infrastructure.xml path/to/profile.xml
sudo ./opensand-network launch sat 0 path/to/topology.xml path/to/infrastructure.xml
sudo ./opensand-network launch st 1 path/to/topology.xml path/to/infrastructure.xml path/to/profile.xml
sudo ./opensand-network launch st 2 path/to/topology.xml path/to/infrastructure.xml path/to/profile.xml
sudo ./opensand-network launch st 3 path/to/topology.xml path/to/infrastructure.xml path/to/profile.xml
```

These commands will each run an OpenSAND process into the designated net-namespaces and wait for
completion. Ideally you want to run them in a dedicated terminal each.

```
sudo ./opensand-network clean
```

This command will remove all the net-namespaces created previously.


> Note that all these commands need to be run as root because they all use the `ip netns exec`
command internally that requires root privileges.

Extra options exists for all these commands, use the `--help` flag to about them.

### Int√©gration with `opensand_cli`

You can use the configurations presented in the `opensand_cli` folders and launch OpenSAND through
the `opensand-network` script. To do so, issue the `make generate-xml` command in the `opensand_cli`
folder of your liking and indicate the path to the generated files to the `opensand-network launch`
command.
