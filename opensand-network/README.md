# OpenSAND Network

This folder provides tools to help network configuration on OpenSAND entities.

The `opensand_network` folder provides a Python module to easily create TAP,
bridges and routing on a machine or inside a net-namespace.

The [`opensand_cli`](opensand_cli/README.md) is a collection of Makefiles to
easily configure your network on a machine and run a simple configuration of
OpenSAND once done.
